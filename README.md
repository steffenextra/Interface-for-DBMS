# Programming an fully functional mysql-library for c++


#	---Install---

# The sockets for xampp on linux and mamp on mac are already implemented if you just want to use this library local.
# Otherwise you need to indentify the location of your sql socket for the communication with an sql-server.
# Specify your adminname, password, socket ip-address and port for the use in the connection-method (example.cpp)
